## Interests

### CTFs

I like participating cybersecurity competitions, take a look at the team I'm part of: [CyberSp3ck](https://cybersp3ck.github.io)

My preferred challenge cathegories are (in order of preference): Binary Exploitation (pwn), Reverse Engineering (rev), Hardware (hw) and Crypto.

### Volleyball

Nothing else to add here, I love the sport and play in an amateur team as a middle blocker.
