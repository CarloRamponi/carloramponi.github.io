This is the result of my six-months internship at [Quarkslab](https://quarkslab.com) in Paris.

During the internship I had the opportunity to analyze and break (literally) a Starlink's User Terminal, extracting the firmware from it and trying to understand how the device works.
You can have a look at my [blog post](https://blog.quarkslab.com/starlink.html) and my [Master's Thesis](./thesis.pdf)
